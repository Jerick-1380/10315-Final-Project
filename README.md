# 10315-Final-Project

For this final project, our team decided to create an machine model for sentiment analysis, which basically reads some sentence and determines whether it consists of a positive or a negative tone. The dataset we will be using is called [Stock-Market Sentiment Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yash612/stockmarket-sentiment-dataset), which consists of 2 columns, the text and whether it's positive or negative. Since these are taken from stock market news, we are also able to apply our model to other news websites and predict their sentiment. Using this, we shall also analyze whether there is a strong correlation between the sentiment of the news as well as the change in price of a tock.

However, in order to 'elevate' our project, we decided to apply a lot of things we learned in 10-315. Hence, we have used the following techniques in creating our model:

- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Regularization
- Naive Bayes
- Gaussian Distrimanant Analysis
- Principal Component Analysis
- Support Vector Machines

Within the scale of this project, our goal is to determine which model would be best for our classification, and whether a combination of these models would achieve a better result.

In the grand scheme of things, our goal is that for future students who might take the course, they could see how the basic theory learned in class can be directly used in projects like these in real life.
